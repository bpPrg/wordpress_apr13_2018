<p style="text-align: justify;">His career took a turn when he got the role of Tommy D in a 2010 British romantic drama film <strong><em>Never Let Me Go</em></strong> and also his performance in an American biographical drama film <strong><em>The Social Network</em></strong> helped in uplifting his career. Both the movies were critically acclaimed and Andrew was widely applauded for his terrifically anguished acting abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew got his breakthrough role when he was cast as <strong><em>Peter Parker/Spiderman</em></strong> in Marc Webbâ€™s <strong><em>The Amazing Spiderman</em></strong> produced by Sony Productions, a reboot to the original Spiderman series, alongside <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/emma-stone-career-upcoming-projects-personal-life-achievements-net-worth-how-rich-is-emma-stone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Emma Stone</em></strong></a> in 2010. The role was a dream come true for Garfield and consequently, he worked hard to do justice for his character. The movie released in July 2012 and became one of the highest grossing movies of that year. The performance of Andrew of a fresh-faced Peter Parker with wry humor skills was well-received globally.Â  Subsequently, he reprised his role as Spiderman in <strong><em>The Amazing Spiderman 2</em></strong> which was also a success in box office. Later in February 2015, Sony and Marvels made a deal that integrated Spiderman character into <strong><em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em></strong> ergo the sequels to the Amazing Spiderman 2 were canceled and recently the role of Spiderman is taken over by <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/tom-holland-career-personal-life-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Holland</a>.</p>
