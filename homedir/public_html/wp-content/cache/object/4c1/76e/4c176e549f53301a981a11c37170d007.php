He is in Germany with the club officials in order to bring Pierre Emerick Aubameyang as a direct replacement for Alexis Sanchez, who is somehow sure to go to their rivals Manchester United in very close time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dortmund Had released a statement some days before for the inquiry of the player Aubameyang by the clubs but they didnâ€™t assure of the bid. But they didnâ€™t keep it secret so the chief of Arsenal being in Germany with the club official and as Arsenal are also searching for same to the same replacement for Alexis it's going sure for the transfer to go in coming days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has made it clear to leave the Dortmund side so considering that and with the rumors going in all sense this transfer looks to happen in coming days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aubameyang being dropped out of the squad in recent games and also the sporting director Michael Zorc commenting â€œ he has other situation in his head to clear out at this moment â€œ Â boosts the rumors to be true.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With 31 goals in the last season and having 13 goals in 15 games, this season the â‚¬ 50 million bid from arsenal and player willing to go may make this situation strong and the transfer might be in the days to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So Cheers gunners for the <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/alexis-sanchez-step-closer-move-arsenal-join-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexis Sanchez</a> replacement.</p>
