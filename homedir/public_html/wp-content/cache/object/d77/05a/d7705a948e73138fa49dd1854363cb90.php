It is reported earlier that <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-8-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coutinho</a> is traveling to Spain and expected to watch Barcelona La Liga match against in Camp Nou on Sunday afternoon. Coutinho move to Barcelona from Liverpool is the second most expensive transfer of all time behind his Brazilian teammate Neymar who left Barcelona to join PSG. Liverpool signed <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippe Coutinho</a> in 2013 from Inter Milan for <b>Â£</b>8.5m.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-837" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/coutinho-camp-nou_130aukzvv82a31e0d89p3vhm60-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="304" />Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was determined last summer that his player <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coutinho</a> would not be allowed to leave and rejected a bid from Barcelona however, Liverpoolâ€™s stand has softened, as they get ready for the deal to take place now. <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippe Coutinho</a> scored 54 goals in 200 matches for Liverpool.Â  Liverpool was eager to keep their star playmaker until the end of the season, but Coutinhoâ€™s side made it clear that they wanted to deal happened immediately.

<p style="text-align: justify;">He could make his debut on Thursday in the Spanish Cup against Celta Vigo but will not able to play in the Champions League for Barcelona. So his presence will be important for La Liga and Copa del Rey.Â  <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coutinho</a> presence in the squad can replace Barcelona legend playmaker Andres Iniesta. Luis Suarez and <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coutinho</a> are going to play for the same clubs again, as a former teammate are considered very close on Merseyside. Barcelona spent <b>Â£</b>97m for Ousmane Dembele on last transfer window and now they offer Liverpool huge amount for <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/">Philippe Coutinho</a>. It is the highest fee for a player sold by an English club and that is also a record.Â  Liverpool club is searching for a talent to replace <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-7-players-can-replace-philippe-coutinho-liverpool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philippe Coutinho</a> and Monacoâ€™s Thomas Lemar is their main target. <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/france-road-russia-fifa-world-cup-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France</a> international Thomas Lemar wonders all with his amazing move and skills but Ligue 1 club are unwilling to sell in this transfer window. Recently Liverpool signed defender Virgil van Dijk from Southampton for <b>Â£</b>75m.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-836" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cautino-to-barca-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="456" /></p>
