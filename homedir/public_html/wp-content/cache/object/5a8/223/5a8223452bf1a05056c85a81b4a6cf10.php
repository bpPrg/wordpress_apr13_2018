<p style="text-align: justify;">Around two years ago, some producer launched onto the event gaining an amazing and superb amount of publicity quickly. The name was Marshmello and he had different looks that you could never forget. The reason you could never forget his looks is that his face is a cartoon marshmallow mask. He was immediately supported by established producers such as Dotcom and Jauz with repost to their social media. His music was fun, simple and an overnight sensation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">True identities of the artist cannot be overshadowed by the Masks but this is where we see a different-nobody knows who Marshmello is, well maybe the better way to say it is that Marshmello has never confirmed his identity and officially come out. There have been many speculations over the years he has been active as a producer. Some people seem to be guessing him as a Skrillex, Deadmau5 but alas it was soon revealed that Marshmello was neither definitively Deadmau5 nor Skrillex.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At the time of his arrival to the world of dance music. His sound was incredible, exciting and original. It was filled with intense bass and had its roots deep dubstep and hip-hop. He quickly capitalized on his success with many high profile remixes for artist such as Zedd, Diplo, Skrillex and Adele. This is when everybody began to arise a question that who the hell was this newcomer with a bold new sound and is supported by officials. He then collaborated with much high profile singer and producer that earned him more than $21 million in the 12 months of the period and also named in Forbes annual ranking of World‚Äôs highest-paid DJs.He released a song titled ‚ÄúLOVE U‚Äù as appreciation to his well-wishers.</p>
