<p style="text-align: justify;">Manchester City searching for a new <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-11-best-centre-backs-in-2018-fifa-world-cup-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">center back</a> this season has identified Laporte as a top target. Due to injury problems of Vincent Kompany and John Stones, Pep Guardiola is keen to strengthenÂ his defense by welcoming Laporte to Manchester City this season. Bad performanceÂ from John Stones and Mangala is forcing Pep to buy a new <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-11-best-centre-backs-in-2018-fifa-world-cup-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centerÂ back</a> this season. So LaporteÂ seems to be the <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-11-best-centre-backs-in-2018-fifa-world-cup-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">center back</a> that has caught Pep's eyes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the journal Mundo Deportivo, Athletic Bilbao is searching for Laporte's replacement. Inigo Martinez and Nacho Monreal are said to be two <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-11-best-centre-backs-in-2018-fifa-world-cup-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">center backs</a> that Athletic Bilbao is scouting to fill the void left by Laporte.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Laporte also seems to be ready for agreeing to terms with Manchester City as he is eyeing for Premier league move and has a chance to play in Champions league. It seems that Athletic Bilbao will sell Laporte this season to Manchester City since they are getting huge offer including add-on.</p>
