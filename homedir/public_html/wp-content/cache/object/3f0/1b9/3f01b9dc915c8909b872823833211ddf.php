Head coach Pep Guardiola is ready to spend 50 million pounds for him this January as he is catching eyes of many top teams including Manchester United.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">24 years old <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/brazil-road-russia-fifa-world-cup-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazilian</a> midfielder who has identified himself as a <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/top-11-best-defensive-midfielder-in-2018-fifa-world-cup-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defensive midfielder</a> is known to be a long-term plan for Pep Guardiola. Due to the old age of Fernandinho and Yaya Toure, Fred is supposed to replace them at Manchester City in near future. ShakhtarÂ was the same team who sold Fernandinho to Manchester City in 2013 for 30 million pounds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Shakhtar Donetsk is reluctant to sell their main player in mid-season due to champion league fixtures, Manchester City is pushing very hard to make the deal happen. Shakhtar will be facing AS Roma at the round of 16 in the champions league this season. Manchester City fear to lose him for other clubs and pushing very hard to make the deal happen by offering huge money. Fred already said he is eager to join Manchester City and waiting for a call from Pep Guardiola. Will Brazilian defensive midfielder be Manchester city this season? We have to see until January transfer window opens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shakhtar Donetsk's chief executive director, Sergei Palkin, was supposed to have traveledÂ to Manchester during Champions league match back in December to talk about the potential deal. This may be a good news to Manchester City fans.</p>
