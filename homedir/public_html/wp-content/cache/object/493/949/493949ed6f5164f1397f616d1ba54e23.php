He was praised heavily by ex Barcelona maestro Xavi about his playing styles, visions and midfield control. He was also heavily scouted by Barcelona and linked with him multiple times for replacement of Xavi.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ivory Coast midfielder has established himself as a versatile "regista" in modern football. Regista is a typical football position when often called deep-lying playmaker who controls tempo of midfield heavily like Xavi Alonso and Pirlo. Seri is slowly developing himself as a typical registaÂ with the likes of modern world-classÂ registas Verrati and Kroos.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to his versatility in playing style, Manchester United and Manchester City are in the race to sign him this season. United want to replace him with their quality registaÂ Carrick. Similarly, Pep Guardiola also wants to boost his midfield options by adding him. Seri has a release clause of 35 million pounds with French club Nice. Both Manchester clubs are eager to trigger his release clause this season.</p>

Which Manchester Club can lure him this or next season, we will have to wait and see.
