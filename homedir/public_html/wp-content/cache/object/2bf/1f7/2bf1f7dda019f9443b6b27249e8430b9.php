Talking about Manchester United, Coach Jose Mourinho started Jese Lingard along with Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku. English men Lingard started ahead of Juan Mata and Mikhitaryan who were supposed to be out of form lately. Jose setup 3-4-2-1 formation with Paul Pogba at central midfield partnering defensive midfielder Nemanja Matic, a new summer signing from Chelsea. Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia provided width as Marcos Rojo played 3-man defense with Lindelof and Chris Smalling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, manager of home team Arsenal, Arsene Wenger setup as the usual formation of 3-4-2-1 where he used to play this season. Trio of Lacazatte, Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ã–zil started in attacking front line. Back three of defense played with Mustafi, Koscielny and Nacho Monreal. Hector Bellerin and Kolasinac provided width from wing back position. Aaron Ramsey played central midfield along with defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a 4<sup>th</sup> minute of the match, Antonio Valencia finds a net as Monreal was unable to block the shot from him. In 11<sup>th</sup> minute, a small mistake from Arsenal defender Mustafi costs Arsenal another goal as Jese Lingard scored another from a quick pass of Anthony Martial and put Manchester United 2-0 lead before halftime. Due to errors and poor gameplay, German man Mustafi was immediately substituted as Alex Iwobi replaces him. Although Lacazatte scored in the 49<sup>th</sup> minute but the home team sees a loss when Jese Lingard scored another at 63<sup>rd</sup> minute as Jose Mourinho collect three points ending the match 3-1 for Manchester United. The 74<sup>th</sup> minute of a red card for Paul Pogba, he will not be available for the big derby match against Manchester City next weekend which was the only thing to be a worry for Joseâ€™s side.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Manchester United goalkeeper De Gea stands out to be top performer and man of the match as he keeps the record of 14 saves in this game for the first time in Premier league by any keeper. Due to his huge saves, Arsenal was not able to put past goal against him despite having more possession and more pass completion. With this win, Manchester United are 2<sup>nd</sup> in Premier league table with 35 points and Arsenal on 5<sup>th</sup> of the table with 28 points.</p>
