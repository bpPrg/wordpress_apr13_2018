Coutinho signed a long-term contract of five years at Liverpool in January 2017 with no release clause which keeps him at the club up to 2022. Despite signing the contract, Coutinho was admitting his dream for playing FC Barcelona. In August, the summer transfer window after season 2016/17 ends, Barcelonaâ€™s bid of 72 million pounds was rejected by Liverpool. Coutinho immediately hands transfer to Liverpool requesting him to leave the club for Barcelona via email. Because of no release clause in his contract and less time for finding his replacement as the transfer window was closing soon, Liverpool holds him by rejecting two more bids from Barcelona with a fee up to 120 million pounds which included necessary add-on. Due to this, he is playing 2017/18 season at Liverpool with 10 goals and 7 assists before Christmas. But it is expected that Barcelona will again come after him by improving bids in this January transfer window or next summer. So Liverpool is scouting a number of players from different leagues for his replacement.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-423" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-7-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="408" />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Letâ€™s have a quick review of his playing positions and playing style. Due to his versatility, Coutinho has been playing in the number of positions as per other playersâ€™ availability. He is generally attacking a minded creative player that favors to play no.10 position. Last season he played as winger aside Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. But this season, after incoming of Mohamed Salah, Jurgen Klopp is using him in different positions. Due to his creativity, he was moved to central midfield position and switches to no.10 also behind Mane, Firmino and Salah. In Sadio Maneâ€™s absence, he replaces him and plays as a left winger. In Salahâ€™s absence h, replaces him and plays as right winger. Due to his mobility in front line and midfield role, he is easily getting goals and assists this season. So there are very few players that can actually replace him and offer equal attack and creativity. Before moving into players that can replace him, here are two images of Coutinhoâ€™s position used by Jurgen Klopp in recent matches.</p>
