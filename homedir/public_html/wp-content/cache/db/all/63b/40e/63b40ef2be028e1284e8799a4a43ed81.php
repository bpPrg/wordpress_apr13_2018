Coutinho signed a long-term contract of five years at Liverpool in January 2017 with no release clause which keeps him at the club up to 2022. Despite signing the contract, Coutinho was admitting his dream for playing FC Barcelona. In August, the summer transfer window after season 2016/17 ends, Barcelonaâ€™s bid of 72 million pounds was rejected by Liverpool. Coutinho immediately hands transfer to Liverpool requesting him to leave the club for Barcelona via email. Because of no release clause in his contract and less time for finding his replacement as the transfer window was closing soon, Liverpool holds him by rejecting two more bids from Barcelona with a fee up to 120 million pounds which included necessary add-on. Due to this, he is playing 2017/18 season at Liverpool with 10 goals and 7 assists before Christmas. But it is expected that Barcelona will again come after him by improving bids in this January transfer window or next summer. So Liverpool is scouting a number of players from different leagues for his replacement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Letâ€™s have a quick review of his playing positions and playing style. Due to his versatility, Coutinho has been playing in the number of positions as per other playersâ€™ availability. He is generally attacking a minded creative player that favors to play no.10 position. Last season he played as winger aside Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. But this season, after incoming of Mohamed Salah, Jurgen Klopp is using him in different positions. Due to his creativity, he was moved to central midfield position and switches to no.10 also behind Mane, Firmino and Salah. In Sadio Maneâ€™s absence, he replaces him and plays as a left winger. In Salahâ€™s absence h, replaces him and plays as right winger. Due to his mobility in front line and midfield role, he is easily getting goals and assists this season. So there are very few players that can actually replace him and offer equal attack and creativity. Before moving into players that can replace him, here are two images of Coutinhoâ€™s position used by Jurgen Klopp in recent matches.</p>

He is in Germany with the club officials in order to bring Pierre Emerick Aubameyang as a direct replacement for Alexis Sanchez, who is somehow sure to go to their rivals Manchester United in very close time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dortmund Had released a statement some days before for the inquiry of the player Aubameyang by the clubs but they didnâ€™t assure of the bid. But they didnâ€™t keep it secret so the chief of Arsenal being in Germany with the club official and as Arsenal are also searching for same to the same replacement for Alexis it's going sure for the transfer to go in coming days.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1196" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAIN-Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang-and-an-Arsenal-badge-300x167.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="236" />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has made it clear to leave the Dortmund side so considering that and with the rumors going in all sense this transfer looks to happen in coming days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aubameyang being dropped out of the squad in recent games and also the sporting director Michael Zorc commenting â€œ he has other situation in his head to clear out at this moment â€œ Â boosts the rumors to be true.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1197" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tmrmjxahcjsfi2sretg25a63ac273fc0e-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="289" />
<p style="text-align: justify;">With 31 goals in the last season and having 13 goals in 15 games, this season the â‚¬ 50 million bid from arsenal and player willing to go may make this situation strong and the transfer might be in the days to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So Cheers gunners for the <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/alexis-sanchez-step-closer-move-arsenal-join-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexis Sanchez</a> replacement.</p>
