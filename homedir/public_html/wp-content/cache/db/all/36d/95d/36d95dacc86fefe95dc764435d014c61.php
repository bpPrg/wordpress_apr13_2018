He is in Germany with the club officials in order to bring Pierre Emerick Aubameyang as a direct replacement for Alexis Sanchez, who is somehow sure to go to their rivals Manchester United in very close time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dortmund Had released a statement some days before for the inquiry of the player Aubameyang by the clubs but they didnâ€™t assure of the bid. But they didnâ€™t keep it secret so the chief of Arsenal being in Germany with the club official and as Arsenal are also searching for same to the same replacement for Alexis it's going sure for the transfer to go in coming days.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1196" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAIN-Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang-and-an-Arsenal-badge-300x167.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="236" />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has made it clear to leave the Dortmund side so considering that and with the rumors going in all sense this transfer looks to happen in coming days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aubameyang being dropped out of the squad in recent games and also the sporting director Michael Zorc commenting â€œ he has other situation in his head to clear out at this moment â€œ Â boosts the rumors to be true.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1197" src="http://wikiceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tmrmjxahcjsfi2sretg25a63ac273fc0e-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="289" />
<p style="text-align: justify;">With 31 goals in the last season and having 13 goals in 15 games, this season the â‚¬ 50 million bid from arsenal and player willing to go may make this situation strong and the transfer might be in the days to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So Cheers gunners for the <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/alexis-sanchez-step-closer-move-arsenal-join-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexis Sanchez</a> replacement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Career </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew stepped into the acting world via theatre since he was 9 years old where he appeared in a youth theatre production of Bugsy Malone. After graduating in 2004, he primarily focused on stage acting and gave many powerful performances in some stage shows such as in <strong><em>Kes</em></strong> (2004) and <strong><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></strong>(2005) at <strong><em>Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre</em></strong> where his performance was highly acclaimed. His other theatre performances include <strong><em>The Laramie Project</em></strong> (2005), <strong><em>Beautiful Thing</em></strong> (2006), <strong><em>Burn/Chatroom/ Citizenship</em></strong> (2006) and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">His career took a turn when he got the role of Tommy D in a 2010 British romantic drama film <strong><em>Never Let Me Go</em></strong> and also his performance in an American biographical drama film <strong><em>The Social Network</em></strong> helped in uplifting his career. Both the movies were critically acclaimed and Andrew was widely applauded for his terrifically anguished acting abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew got his breakthrough role when he was cast as <strong><em>Peter Parker/Spiderman</em></strong> in Marc Webbâ€™s <strong><em>The Amazing Spiderman</em></strong> produced by Sony Productions, a reboot to the original Spiderman series, alongside <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/emma-stone-career-upcoming-projects-personal-life-achievements-net-worth-how-rich-is-emma-stone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Emma Stone</em></strong></a> in 2010. The role was a dream come true for Garfield and consequently, he worked hard to do justice for his character. The movie released in July 2012 and became one of the highest grossing movies of that year. The performance of Andrew of a fresh-faced Peter Parker with wry humor skills was well-received globally.Â  Subsequently, he reprised his role as Spiderman in <strong><em>The Amazing Spiderman 2</em></strong> which was also a success in box office. Later in February 2015, Sony and Marvels made a deal that integrated Spiderman character into <strong><em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em></strong> ergo the sequels to the Amazing Spiderman 2 were canceled and recently the role of Spiderman is taken over by <a href="http://wikiceleb.com/tom-holland-career-personal-life-net-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Holland</a>.</p>
